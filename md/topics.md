## Topics:
1. Introduction to Computer Networks
   - Computer networks allow devices to exchange data and resources.
   - The role of networks in the modern world: information exchange, resource access, cloud services.

2. Types of Computer Networks
   - Local Area Networks (LANs): limited geographical area, high data transfer rates.
   - Wide Area Networks (WANs): long distances, use various technologies for communication.
   - Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs): cover a city or large area.

3. Network Architecture
   - Client-Server Architecture: server provides resources, clients request them.
   - Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networks: devices interact directly, sharing resources.

4. Network Components
   - Devices: computers, routers, switches, access points.
   - Cables and Transmission Media: twisted pair, optical fiber, wireless connections.
   - Routers and Switches: facilitate data transmission in networks.

5. Data Transmission Principles
   - Analog Transmission: continuous signals, used in analog devices.
   - Digital Transmission: discrete signals, more reliable and resistant to interference.
   - Modulation Methods: amplitude, frequency, phase modulation.

6. IP Addressing, Subnets, and Routing
   - IP Addresses: unique identifiers for devices in a network.
   - Subnets: dividing IP address space into smaller blocks.
   - Routing: selecting the optimal path for data transmission.

7. OSI Model Layers
   - Physical Layer: bit transmission over physical medium.
   - Data Link Layer: access control, error detection.
   - Network Layer: routing and data forwarding between networks.
   - Transport Layer: reliable data transfer between devices.
   - Session Layer: session establishment, maintenance, and termination.
   - Presentation Layer: data encoding, compression, and encryption.
   - Application Layer: data exchange between applications.

8. Data Encapsulation and Decapsulation
   - Encapsulation: packaging data at each OSI layer.
   - Decapsulation: unpacking data at each OSI layer.

9. Communication Protocols
   - Communication protocols define rules and formats for data exchange between devices.
   - Protocols for session establishment, management, and termination.

10. Types of Protocols
    - TCP/IP: reliable data transmission.
    - UDP: fast, unreliable data transmission.
    - HTTP/HTTPS: web page retrieval.
    - FTP: file transfer.
    - SMTP/POP3/IMAP: email communication.
    - DNS: domain name to IP address translation.
    - SNMP: network device management.
    - SSL/TLS: data encryption for secure transmission.

11. Operation of Transport Protocols
    - TCP: reliable, ordered data transfer.
    - UDP: simple, connectionless data transfer.

12. Client-Server Interaction Principles
    - Clients send requests, servers provide resources.
    - Protocols define request and response structures.

13. Application Layer Protocols
    - HTTP: web communication.
    - SMTP/POP3/IMAP: email.
    - DNS: domain name resolution.
    - SNMP: network device management.

14. Secure Communication Protocols
    - SSL/TLS: encryption for secure transmission.

15. Network Programming
    - Sockets: network connection handling.
    - Client-Server Architecture.
    - Examples: network applications (chat, data clients, etc.).

16. Network Resource Management
    - DHCP: automatic IP address configuration.
    - NAT: network address translation.
    - QoS: quality of service provision.

17. Cloud Computing and Networks
    - Network virtualization.
    - Working with cloud providers.
    - Containerization and orchestration.

18. Cisco Networking
